## Reporting a Vulnerability

### NOTE
Please at least wait 90 days or for us to fix it before you disclose the issue to the public.

Please contact [@Semisol (click to mail)](mailto:me@smileycreations15.com?title=ScratchVerifier%20Vulnerability%20Report)<!-- more coming soon--> to explain the security  
issue in detail. We will review your report and if your report is valid, we will be patching the vulnerability and
creating a security advisory. Until the advisory is public, please do not disclose the issue to others. 
If you do not mind being credited, please provide your GitHub username, or full name/pseudonym and/or email, so that we can credit you in the security advisory. 
Providing your GitHub username will allow us to create a temporary private fork to fix this issue. Otherwise, please send us the changes you propose in the Git patch format instead.
