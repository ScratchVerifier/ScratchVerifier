## Guidelines
(NOT DONE)
Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ScratchVerifier/ScratchVerifier/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before proceeding. 
The following behaviour is not encouraged:
- Posting issues with very simple descriptions, or unconstructive criticism. We would like you to in detail explain what can be done, what is wrong and what could get an update.
- Irrelevant discussions: Please move to our Gitter channel off-topic (coming soon) to continue any discussions. Any long off-topic discussions could make the discussion get marked as offtopic, removed or the issue locked outright if the problem is worse enough
- PRs with nearly no effort: We want to make quality code, so please submit a PR that has work in it. Copying code is fine, (everyone does that) but we will not accept any changes which do not provide any benefit to the project or its users.
- PRs which require modules or code from a private project: We are trying to make this a self-hostable application. Any PR making this project non-self hostable will be rejected.

The following behaviour is not allowed:
- Spam and advertisements: Please do not advertise in our repositor. You may link to other sites to demonstrate features you would want or examples. You will get warned, then you will be blocked if you have too many offenses or the spam you have posted is severe enough.
